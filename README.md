# Portfolio

This is my Web Development portfolio. The main index page contains a general about me section that can be found underneath the parralax 
background image. The top right of the navbar contains links to all the available pages e.g. Contact - Portfolio - Resume.

The Portfolio page contains a carousel of websites that I've created. The carousel may be navigated by clicking on the left most image 
or the right most image. To navigate to a site just click on it when it becomes the center image and it will open the page in a new tab.

The Contact page contains a form for submiting a message. Just fill out all the neccesary info and hit send. The contact form utilizes a firebase database to receive and save messages.

The Resume page contains my resume in pdf format. The resume can be downloaded by clicking on the download button underneath the image.
